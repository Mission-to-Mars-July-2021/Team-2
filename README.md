## Day 1 Retrospective

### What went well
We understood what we needed to do and we realised the difficulty of this process

### What didn't go well
We didn't communicate at all and we needed to pay attention more to what was being taught as we all ended up becoming confused.

### What we will do more of tomorrow
We will try to pay attention more to what the instructors say and we will also put some time into communicating with eachother so that the process becomes a lot easier.

### What we will do less of tomorrow

We will not be lazy and we will also reduce the time we spend doing nothing. Instead we will experiment more with the software.
